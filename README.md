# SbeNet-for-Defect-Detection

This repository is the offical implementation of Two-stage Deep Neural Network with Joint Loss and Multi-level Representations for Defect Detection. Up to now, we have uploaded the code and the pre-trained model. Due to the size of the dataset, we will provide the method of obtaining the dataset and the usage of the code later.
